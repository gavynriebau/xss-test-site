# XSS Test Site

This is a micro site, simulating a very bad bank, for the purpose of learning about and practising cross site scripting (XSS) exploits.

Code from this site is based on content from the lecture notes for [Stanford University CS253 Web Security course](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs253/).
